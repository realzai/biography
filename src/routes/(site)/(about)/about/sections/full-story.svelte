			I wasn't a normal kid from the start. Both of my parents were university teachers, which meant
			they were broke. But fortunately, I grew up in an educated environment, and everyone loved me.
			Not sure if it was luck, but I didn't have a single friend from my neighborhood for 18 years.
			I had to spend most of my time studying and doing things in front of the computer (gaming, of
			course).
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			I was extremely smart; I could understand concepts that college students struggled to grasp. I
			could draw floor plan drawings since I was 10. It was a curse, not a gift. You won't
			understand how isolated I was, but thanks to my mom and dad, I never felt lonely.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			I didn't attend a normal high school; I went to a technological high school. And I was a star,
			thanks to my mom and dad. The teachers were either their friends or their students. I was
			unstoppable. Every girl knew me. Honestly, I regret bullying (not extremely) some friends
			because of that. If you're reading this, I'm really sorry for that. I met friends I would
			never have met if I had gone to a normal high school.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			Another curse for me: I didn't have a chance to choose which university I wanted to attend. My
			parents didn't force me to attend that school or become a Civil Engineer, but I was a good
			kid, so I listened. After graduating, I had to move to a different city because I had no
			choice. Then I moved and met amazing people. They were smarter than me, and that's when I
			realized I was nothing. Most of them were ex-med students, and I was the black sheep. They
			were older than me, and they loved me. I was the youngest and the loudest.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			Covid said 'knock knock', and I came back home, thinking that everything would be okay after
			one or two months. I met a girl, and my heart was broken. I didn't even love her, but I felt
			like I had lost everything for a moment. Then I recovered, started doing workouts, and met a
			girl online again. She was a billionaire's daughter, but I loved her just because of who she
			was.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			As a kid who grew up mostly alone, I was a bad communicator. I didn't know how to express
			love, and she was rich, so it didn't end well. I loved her so much that I still waited for her
			for more than three years after we broke up. It's a long story, but she chose a rich and older
			guy in the end. After breaking up, I changed; I learned Japanese and passed N2 (the
			second-highest level). I wanted to go to Japan and live my life happily.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			After meeting Nick, everything changed, and I started my journey as an entrepreneur. It wasn't
			a wise decision after all. We dreamed, we discussed, we built, and I was happy until the war
			broke out at the worst possible time. I had an exam from UoPeople, and we were building the
			website, but I had to leave my home suddenly. I could hear the gunshots, I saw the helicopter
			bombing and shooting at the ground clearly. I was scared; I didn't want to die yet.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			Fortunately, I escaped and slept at a refugee camp (a temple). It was a terrible place; I was
			the only Gen Z male at the temple, and most of the people there were women. I needed to take
			the exam online, but it wasn't okay for me to take it in front of 20 people. So I slept
			outside, and it was freezing cold. I missed my home, more importantly my cat and my dogs; I
			was worried about them. I passed the exam, and the battles stopped near my home. Since then,
			I've heard the sounds of bombs every night.
		</p>

		<p class="leading-loose">
			We moved to the inner city (my father's friend's home). The Wi-Fi was terrible; only one
			expensive provider was left in this war-torn city. A startup without the internet? I should
			give up, right? No, I didn't stop building the product, Premia, even in that situation.
			Startups are meant to fail, and it's true. A kid from a place far from the city is starting a
			startup at the front tier. We didn't get funded, nor did we get a single loyal customer. It's
			time to give up, right? No...
